          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p id="par1"> <strong id="st1">Cod, (genus Gadus) :</strong><br><br> and economically important marine fish of the family Gadidae.<br>
               The species Gadus morhua is found on both sides of the North Atlantic. A cold-water fish, 
               it generally remains near the bottom, ranging from inshore regions to deep waters.<br>
                It is valued for its edible flesh, the oil of its liver, and other products.<br>
                 A dark-spotted fish with three dorsal fins, two anal fins, and a chin barbel,
                  it varies in colour from greenish or grayish to brown or blackish, though it may also be dull to bright red.

          <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><p id="par2"><strong id="st2">fish :</strong> <br><br> of approximately 34,000 species of vertebrate animals (phylum Chordata) found in the fresh and salt waters of the world. <br>
            Living species range from the primitive jawless lampreys and hagfishes through the cartilaginous sharks, skates, and rays to the abundant and diverse bony fishes. <br>
             fish species are cold-blooded:<br>
              however, one species, the opah (Lampris guttatus), is warm-blooded.<br>
               The term fish is applied to a variety of vertebrates of several evolutionary lines.<br>
             It describes a life-form rather than a taxonomic group.<br>
              As members of the phylum Chordata, fish share certain features with other vertebrates.<br>
               These features are gill slits at some point in the life cycle, a notochord, or skeletal supporting rod,
                a dorsal hollow nerve cord, and a tail.<br>
                 Living fishes represent some five classes, which are as distinct from one another as are the four classes of familiar air-breathing animals—amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.</p></div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 "><p><strong id="st3">soup :</strong><br><br> liquid food prepared by cooking meat, poultry, fish, legumes, or vegetables with seasonings in water, stock, milk, or some other liquid medium.<br>
             The cooking of soup is as ancient as the devising of vessels to hold liquid; before the development of pots that could withstand the direct heat of a fire, soups were cooked by dropping hot stones into the liquid.<br>
              The long cooking of soup enabled nourishment to be drawn from meagre quantities of fish and meat too bony or tough to be otherwise utilized.<br>

            In the West lighter soups are usually served as a first course, while thicker, heartier soups constitute the entrée for informal meals.<br>
             A notable exception are the fruit soups favoured in northern and eastern Europe, which are often served for dessert. <br>
             In China a thin soup is consumed throughout the meal as a beverage, and elaborate soups such as the celebrated bird’s nest and shark’s fin may be interspersed with other courses or served near the end of the meal.<br>

            
            Many soups are eaten cold.<br>
             French vichyssoise (potatoes and leeks), Spanish gazpacho (tomatoes and other vegetables), Polish chlodnik (beets, sour cream, pickles, and shellfish), Jewish schav (sorrel), and Danish kaernemaelkskoldskaal (buttermilk) are classic cold soups.<br>
              Consommé can be served cold, in which case it takes the form of a jelly as a result of the natural gelatin present in the bony meats from which it is prepared.<br>
